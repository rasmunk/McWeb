This directory is used to store the OCI configuration file. 
This should be named 'config'

This directory is also used to store the OCI RSA keys. 
This should be called 'oci_api_key.pem'

'config' is expected to be something of the form:

```
[DEFAULT]
user=
fingerprint=
key_file=
tenancy=
region=
pass_phrase=
```
